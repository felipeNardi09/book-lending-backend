### Bookify, lend books online

This is the API of a lending books project called Bookify. Create an account/login to generate a JWT (JSON Web Token) and access the project's most important routes. You can create a new book for people to borrow, see all the books available, borrow a book, and return it so other people can borrow it.

The project is being developed for learning and portfolio purposes. It was built using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) , [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/), [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) and much more.

Some features yet to be implemented: images upload and some adjustments.

### Installing
Install the project dependencies:
 `npm install`
   or
  `yarn`

### Running the project
Create and account or log in to your MongoDB account([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)). Create a New Project and a new Database. Connect the project to the database to perform all the API actions.
To test routes that require e-mails you can use [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/).
